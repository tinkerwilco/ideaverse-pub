# call graham @ delta re: in-water stuffing box repacking, or learn how to do it myself in the water.
# Winter 2025 projects checklist
- [ ] remove the Onan genset injectors and have them cleaned by Uncle Aaron (this genset needs other attention such as sending the heat exchanger to Seattle Radiator works and plumbing in new fuel lines and a new primary Racor for it)
- [ ] fix sink in stateroom
- [ ] clean LectraSan box (in the aft head. also may just remove it to sell but need to clean it either way.)

# starboard engine, open issues

## stop solenoid + relay needs to be rewired
This solenoid seems to be broken. I ordered a new one. I also am considering just changing to a cable, which is recommended by some online due to these weird relay setups and solenoid failures.
After trying to route the cable method it simply got in the way of access too much, so I will be going back to solenoid stop method.
## RPM gauge needs to be hooked back up
These should be a small wire on each alternator. Out of two small wires, one is the signal wire and the other is this RPM driver. Either on a spade or ring terminal.
Port side RPM gauge works now.
## water temp and oil pressure on starboard side need to be hooked back up to the loom
All sensors need testing so I understand how to troubleshoot later. Need to know the baseline values and where to probe to get them.
# 12v circuits, open issues
## deck wash pumps (I think it just needs to be wired and the plumbing is already done, seacock just needs to be opened, the one near starboard reverse gear)
## some nav lights: rear white, and high white still not working
## horn not working
# engines and gearboxes, closed issues
## ✅ 1: Port ignition switch not firing the starter
I replaced both start relays and one of the relay harness/plug ends which was very corroded inside.
## ✅starboard transmission stop switch needs rewired
But why was it cut out of the loop? Do I even need this? I removed both instead of fixing the second one. I really do not see a need for this feature for me personally.
## ✅Starboard v-belt is worn
Replaced Aug 2024!
## ✅Starboard harmonic balancer seems wobbly
Shakedown cruise Aug 2024 it did fine during two 4-hour trips, so I guess it's just visual with how the paint is peeling off?
# ✅120v for house, open issues
## ✅Outback inverter is not connected to shore power due to poor wiring conditions.
## ✅Heavy gauge cables can be connected directly to gel 8d to power galley outlets and the remote panel does work, but it really should be done properly with an off switch and a pretty large fuse!
# ✅12v for house, open issues
[[+/85CHB38 electrical panel notes\|85CHB38 electrical panel notes]] from Jeff Small
## ✅fixed 12v circuits
- cabin lights in all 3 rooms
- some nav lights (rear white, and high white still not working)
- bilge pump 1 and sump pump 1
- windlass (not currently wired up due to battery decisions)
- depth finder and speed
- engine room intake blower (now making some noise, so need to oil motor bearings and make sure intake tube is adjusted properly. I currently have the tube remove from the wall inlet because it just got in the way and looked pretty awful, and I had wanted to try using that through-hull fitting for exhausting the air from the heat pump, although I decided not to keep that set up, so the inlet is disconnected and blocked with a rag right now since it's cold in the winter and I'm trying to keep it warm-ish in there.)
- toilet macerator (possibly also a pump here)
-  water pressure pump (is there more than one in this system of tubes?)
-  radar (replace with Garmin Echomap MFD?)
- VHF need to decide mounting location and agenda cable to decide power route. Otherwise, just needs to be hooked back up to the correct breaker. Not mounted but works sitting on the dashboard right now, and is connected to one of the antennas (not sure which one but tested to another boat in the marina and they said it sounded perfectly clear)
## ✅ can I connect alternators directly to the 8D gel battery?
Yes, simply connect the alternator B+ wire with enough amperage gauge to a 3/8" stud and extend from there into the selector switch. 
## ✅ can I start both engines from one battery?
Yes, but it is important to not start them up at the same time, because the battery should be given a minute to recharge from the first alternator before cranking it again at engine 2. This has not been an issue but just seems like good practice.
## does the glendinning box work?
Currently I am able to control engines 1 & 2 individually, and so I do not want to test this system until after the Poulsbo Aug 9-11 cruise. Last time I was testing it is when the system became unable to disengage, so I want to take care around testing it once the engines start/stop and electrical connections are all solid.
### notes on the synchronizer from glendinning rep
Synchronizer clutch as described in the manual Section K. Synchronizer clutch is slipping. PROBLEM / SYMPTOM: Additional symptoms: Description of Operation: POSSIBLE PROBLEM RECOMMENDED ACTIONS Lack of bridge cable overtravel-terminal eye on the control cable from helm station control is incorrectly adjusted. AFTER TURNING SYNCHRONIZER OFF, SLAVE ENGINE CONTROL HANDLE IS NOT ABLE TO CONTROL SLAVE ENGINE SPEED. None When Synchronizer control switch is turned OFF, manual control of the slave engine must be reestablished. This is normally accomplished by moving the slave engine control handle back the idle speed position, allowing the bridge control cable to be reconnected mechanically to the engine control cable. Readjust the terminal eye on the bridge control cable at the Synchronizer to achieve proper o travel see Section J of the manual. NOTE: 1) If the overtravel adjustment is slightly OFF, slave engine control may be regained t very rapidly pulling the slave engine handle back to the idle position. On a 2-station ba try regaining manual control at the other helm station. 2) The overtravel adjustment can be thrown off by improper adjustment of the stop so at the control head
