**Meta Goal:**
To influence the reader in the moment and in the future.

**Allowed to:**
not read that book
not finish that book
not read in order (non-fiction)
not have tons of metadata

### Books are not FOR READING, they are FOR THINKING.

3 Decrees for reading:
- build context
- engage with the author
- nurture your enthusiasm

## Part 2 - working that book
first **get the gist**. there is a front cover. what's on it?
title? subtitle? "super" title??
Mine is "The DevOps Handbook" - sub: How to create world-class agility, reliability, & security in technology organizations
what is on the back? blurbs from other authors? a synopsis about the book? info about the author and where they live?
what's on the back flap? this one has info about the authors.
front flap? mine has a book summary that is inspiring.

then **explore the story behind the book**. for DevOps Handbook I see:
second edition was written 5 years after first, in 2021. made in portland oregon. check the structure to the book using the TOC. how many parts? how many chapters? do any of them *stand out* as more relevant or interesting? any themes or patterns already? throughlines, narrative arcs? 
ok for DevOps HB I am seeing: lots of **case studies** and many parts, six parts! 23 chapters.  
what's at *the end* of the book? notes, bibliography, index, appendices, acknowledgements, afterward, coda, call-to-action...anything the author thought was important enough to not leave out.

now **build rapid context with the index** like LiDAR for a book! so go through the index and put a dot next to the things that stand out. do you recognize some terms? how about totally unknown words? words that you did not expect in this book? 
Mine: "information radiators" - "coaching kata" - "organizational culture"(many references for this last one!)
If you ever *get stuck* then pop back to the index and find something that sparks.
