**Meta Goal:**
To influence the reader in the moment and in the future.

**Allowed to:**
not read that book
not finish that book
not read in order (non-fiction)
not have tons of metadata

### Books are not FOR READING, they are FOR THINKING.

3 Decrees for reading:
- build context
- engage with the author
- nurture your enthusiasm

## Part 2 - working that book
first **get the gist**. there is a front cover. what's on it?
title? subtitle? "super" title??
Mine is "The DevOps Handbook" - sub: How to create world-class agility, reliability, & security in technology organizations
what is on the back? blurbs from other authors? a synopsis about the book? info about the author and where they live?
what's on the back flap? this one has info about the authors.
front flap? mine has a book summary that is inspiring.

then **explore the story behind the book**. for DevOps Handbook I see:
second edition was written 5 years after first, in 2021. made in portland oregon. check the structure to the book using the TOC. how many parts? how many chapters? do any of them *stand out* as more relevant or interesting? any themes or patterns already? throughlines, narrative arcs? 
ok for DevOps HB I am seeing: lots of **case studies** and many parts, six parts! 23 chapters.  
what's at *the end* of the book? notes, bibliography, index, appendices, acknowledgements, afterward, coda, call-to-action...anything the author thought was important enough to not leave out.

now **build rapid context with the index** like LiDAR for a book! so go through the index and put a dot next to the things that stand out. do you recognize some terms? how about totally unknown words? words that you did not expect in this book? 
Mine: "information radiators" - "coaching kata" - "organizational culture"(many references for this last one!)
If you ever *get stuck* then pop back to the index and find something that sparks.

now **make notes that actually matter**! have some *emergent quetions* for the book.
#### what is the book about? ...what is it *really* about?
title: DevOps Handbook
		it's about software delivery performance. but it's really about organizational culture and how powerful it is in changing the performance level of teams that use technology.
title: Accelerate
		it's about the research used in the DevOps reports. but it's really about  having data-driven proof that DevOps *does work* and how to leverage this data for implementing changes at your organization.
#### as I experience this book, what questions should I be asking?
title: DevOps Handbook
		if this improvement methodology is so data-proven and so effective when implemented properly, then why do so many organizations still use other, outdated, ineffective methods instead?
#### why do I care about this book?
title: Acccelerate
		because I want to be the person that transforms my organization into a high-performing team of people who enjoy their work and create new innovative approaches to whatever problems arrise.

## Learning is non-linear
- moving around allows:
	- a zoomed out, big picture view
	- you to prioritize, and re-prioritize
	- you a way to play around with finding Flow
## Books are for thinking, not just reading
it only matters what the book caused you to **think**.
think of it as a conversation with the author.
## Context is king
build context big and fast so your reading is more enjoyable and your understanding is more robust.
intuit patterns.
make insights.
