Let's start with the 5 prompts:
1.  That's interesting
2.  That reminds me
3.  It's similar to ... because
4.  It's different from ... because
5.  It's important because

1: Neurodivergence is interesting to me because I live it every day. I am inside of this topic, so it is immediately relevant to me. I want to learn more about myself, so that I can **get to know myself better** (see things in the [[Know Thyself MOC\|Know Thyself MOC]]) and have a more confident sense of my own [[Gender Identity\|Gender Identity]], my [[Autism\|Autism]], and my needs.

2: It reminds me of ... like having a superpower I guess? It's like, a way in which being different can be a huge benefit, but can also make me stand out in such a way that I am constantly misunderstood. I will need to learn [[How to research\|How to research]] better so that I can research various ways to leverage ND in an NT world.

3: It's similar to other medical conditions of the mind because it affects how I think about myself and how I think about my thoughts and how others view me if they know what I am, how I'm different, how I see the world differently. It's also similar because it's not very well understood. It's hard to study the mind because it's the one medical profession that doesn't look at the body "part" in question!

4: It's different from other medical conditions of the mind because it's hard to diagnose and because a lot of people self-diagnose. It's also a huge spectrum, so I'm actually not sure if things like Alzheimer or dementia  have such a broad spectrum. It seems like for those it's just a sliding in one direction: worse and worse over time until death; whereas with neurodivergence one can be anywhere on the wide spectrum and stay there for their entire life and it may not even be a part of why they die later. 

5: It's important to me because I want to understand myself more fully so that I can be present, be genuine, be confident, and help others who may have similar difficulties in understand neurotypicals in society.
