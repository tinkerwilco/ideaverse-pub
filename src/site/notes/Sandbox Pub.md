The pub is where I publish things.
There is a Sandbox Pub and Cafe to symbolize these "third places" in society that have a special quality when it comes to discussions and innovations.
I use the Sandbox Cafe as a symbol of my digital whiteboard which I can share with others. I use that for real-time collaboration, like lean coffee discussions, body-doubling work sessions, and more.
I use the Sandbox Pub as a symbol of my digital laboratory. It is a play on the word publish and public house.
