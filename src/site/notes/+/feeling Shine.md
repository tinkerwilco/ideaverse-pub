# recipe for a new action; create the habit through the brain's reward mechanism
- prompt -> do thing -> feel Shine
- prompt must align with motivation and ability, as per the Fogg Model.
- it helps to feel Shine during each of the 3 phases, as it reinforces different paths to the new habit (such as the feeling of remembering, the act of doing it in physical reality, and the feeling of having just accomplished it)
