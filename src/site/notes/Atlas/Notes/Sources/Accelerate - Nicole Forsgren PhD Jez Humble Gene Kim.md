Key Index Topics:
- **create a learning organization.**
- *DORA metrics*. Measure: delivery lead time, deployment frequency, time to restore service, change fail rate.
- *anxiety*: if engineers feel deployment anxiety, that highlights friction, and is important to measure.
- *cross-functional teams*: can get together on "hack days" to work on a project
- *technical debt*: prioritize "yak days" where teams get together to work on just TD
- *identity*: the extent to which people identified with their organization predicted a generative Westrum Culture, as well as performance in terms of market share and profitability.
- *Lean practices*: limit WIP, visual management, feedback from production, lightweight change approvals.
- *dashboards*: are they used to share info? is info on quality and productivity readily available? are failure rates show publicly on them? important: types of info displayed, how broadly it's shared, how easy it is to access. **visibility is key**.
