## I believe there is a lot of untapped potential in reading, especially in reading physical books and doing the hard work of single focus reading (not reading on a phone or otherwise letting distractions into the same headspace) and so I have created this Map of Books to give myself a place to think about my reading plan. That which gets measured gets managed!

#### - Ongoing list of [[Atlas/Notes/Sources/Books\|Books]] I have read, am reading, or want to read.

#### - A list I want to check out, but not necessarily add all of them to my own reading list: [[+/100 books from David Bowie\|100 books from David Bowie]]

###### things I'm working on personally:
	my own creative expression
	muscle memory of the "flow" of working with my ideas alongside the ideas and content I encounter
	linking notes that are somehow related
	tagging notes in a meaningful way
	investigating and adopting an org structure that I like (folder systems like ACCESS or PARA, or sticking with HOME -> MOCs -> notes layout)
	spending time just casually perusing my ideaverse no matter the current state of projects and productivity.
