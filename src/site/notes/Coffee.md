Coffee Notes

# Big Truck from Olympia Coffee
Chemex:
- 3-cup w/paper filter

- 8-cup w/Kone
Aeropress

V60
French Press
Espresso

# Barn, from Berlin
29MAR (roasted 16MAR)
V60
- 23.5g @36 210° (too hot? try 205°)
- 23.5g @39 202° (also underextracted)
- 23.5g @42 202° (I think this grind is too coarse? tastes maybe under extracted compared to @36)
espresso
- 18g @10 (low )
chemex 3-cup
- 32g @37 198°
- 22g @35 205° (500g water in 2:30 w/1:15 drawdown; this turned out well)
aeropress
- 17.4g @26 176° (smells delicious, woodsy. taste is a bit lighter. how well did it extract though? it doesn't taste bitter. but it doesn't taste "strong" enough either. the mouthfeel is too thin. would that mean more grams of beans but the same grind?)
- 19g @26 176° (better mouthfeel)
French press 
- 25g @54 205° {5 minute method} (great mouthfeel and flavor, good temp, I like this setup)
