# This is my digital garden. I call it the pub as a play on the word public and publish.
#### My concept of a sandbox is a place to experiment. So I have a Sandbox Pub (which is here at pub.tinkerwilco.pro) and also a Sandbox Cafe (which is hosted in Miro and Zoom) to symbolize these places where people can meet, some work can get done, and thoughtful discussions can happen.
### I use the Sandbox Cafe as a symbol of my digital whiteboard which I can share with others. I use that for real-time collaboration, like lean coffee discussions, body-doubling work sessions, and more.
## And the Sandbox Pub is a symbol of my digital laboratory.

The compound is under construction (as of AUG'23), however here are some of the rooms in the pub which you can begin exploring:

### A [[Efforts/Simmering/Coffee\|Coffee]] tasting room, pour-over methods, and an espresso machine.

### Peruse the stacks of [[Atlas/Notes/Sources/Books\|Books]] in the reading room

### In the workshop area, I have been playing around with indieweb, small web, fediverse, alt protocols.
