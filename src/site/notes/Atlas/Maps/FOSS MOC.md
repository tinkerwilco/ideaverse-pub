### Personal Project Ideas


#### Community notes
[[Efforts/Simmering/Community strategy\|Community strategy]]
what do you want in a community?
- A more pluralistic, more humane world, that's sustainable, where artists get their fair share, where audiences and artists understand they're class allies, and allies with all those workers. 
what do you want your community to be?
how will it serve its members?
how will the project or organization benefit?
what goals do you have?
what is the value of this community?
how will you define the community?
who is responsible for the community?
don't start from scratch!

#### XMPP
Jabber ID
Snikket server
XMPP protocol

hello, I am new to snikket and have a question I could not find the answer to on reddit. I have a snikket server in order to use the cheogram and gajim clients. then I found there is also a snikket app on mobile and I opened it and tried to log in using my jabber ID which I assumed was also my XMPP username, but it said it was not a valid XMPP address. I'm still trying to understand more about jmp.chat/snikket/jabber/xmpp and how to use/administer/host all the pieces, and I looked around for advice, but all I saw were a few formats to try like having xmpp: at the front, or @username:server.address or username@server.address etc, none of which worked with the password I use for cheogram and gajim clients. any help or pointing to the right docs would be appreciated.
