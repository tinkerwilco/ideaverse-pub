I'm feeling this:
"I could quite happily be a hermit, but I also need human contact and companionship"
### meditations
"may I be well. may I be happy. may I be peaceful and at ease."
"breathing in, I calm my body. breathing out, I calm my mind."

### thoughts
the idea of "usefulness" has been brought up outside this book. reading this book has me thinking about it again in a different context. is the need to feel useful actually good? is IT useful? perhaps it is only the broken systems full of broken people which produce this feeling, this need. as a disabled person I often feel I should be "more useful" but when I'm feeling okay with myself and feeling compassion for myself and others, I don't really have this thought. I am driven by curiosity, not usefulness. it is capitalism which has engrained in me the idea that I am only worth something if I am useful.
