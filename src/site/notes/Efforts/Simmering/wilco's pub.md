# This is my digital garden. I call it the pub as a hybrid of the public house, and the publishing house. I want to generate ideas, discuss those ideas, and iterate on system designs based on the outcomes of those discussions.

#### My current field of work is analog restoration, in the form of restoring and maintaining old diesel marine vessels. I am the single operator of a [marine service business](https://joshsmarineseattle.com) in Seattle, WA and am currently restoring the 42-foot twin screw [[Efforts/On/1985 CHB Trawler Changing Tides\|1985 CHB Trawler Changing Tides]]

### I also have an interest in other forms of right-to-repair like repairing tech devices, older vehicles, appliances, and anything that has analog components which can be services with OEM or aftermarket parts. I am very interested in fabrication of parts where none are available, but have no yet given time to this path. In the future that may include: machining, additive manufacturing (3-D printing), welding, and other forms of platform/tools development in the analog space.

Something I am investigating right now is the concept of [[Mapping vs Packing\|Mapping vs Packing]]. I do not have a note for this yet but currently I am drawing a [[Atlas/Maps/Map of Books\|Map of Books]] which is intended to help me maintain a healthy reading habit.
